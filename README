kerneltools

kerneltools is a Linux kernel compilation and configuration tool constantly 
under development. Currently it supports compilation and configuration 
on systems containing GRUB2 bootloader. Further support for other 
bootloaders will be supported later on.



What's working right now:

Flags:

--ck : Con Kolivas Linux Patchset

-s, --search : Only search for newest linux version available. When invoked 
with --rc or --ck, it will search for those aswell.

-c : Specify configuration file, or else the program will ask to generate a new one.

--rc : Install Release Candidate kernels

--vbox : Installs vboxhost modules, for invoking virtualbox

--brcm : Installs broadcom-sta modules




What's not working right now(Being worked on every day!):

Flags:

-i : Install flag, although the script searches and installs the newest kernel 
without this flag at the moment.




Other functions:

Removing kernels automatically is not fully functional at the moment.
